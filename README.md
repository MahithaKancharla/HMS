## Project Overview

The Hostel Management System is a user-friendly web platform that centralizes all aspects of hostel administration, including room allocation, facility management and complaint resolution. By digitizing these processes, it enhances efficiency, reduces manual errors, and provides real-time data accessibility to hostel administrators, students, and staff, ultimately improving the overall management experience.
